             <h5>About Me</h5>
             <p>Hello, I’m Samarya Elliott. I am an aspiring political journalist, a student, and a founder. I fell in love with the craft of journalism my third and final year of college. During that time, I took on the concentration of what it takes to become an amazing storyteller, researcher, and bring a better presence in front of the camera. I was an intern previously for a Facebook show entitled “The Game Changers with Angela Ward.” During my time here, I had the privilege to interview political leaders such as Stacy Abrams, Senator David Perdue, Attorney Robert Pattillo, Georgia Chamber CEO Chris Clark and many more. As an intern I took on the responsibility of editing all interviews via Adobe Premiere.</p>
             <p>I the founder of the Karys Foundation Inc. My foundation serves to feeding the homeless and hungry around communities. The Karys Foundation was founded in 2020 after partaking in a small feeding outreach between my mother and I. Since then, outreaching is done once a month and welcomes financial donations as well as volunteers.</p>
             <p>I am from Daytona Beach, Florida. I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Mass Media from Valdosta State University in May 2020. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Political Communication at the University of Florida. I love personal training at the gym, traveling, exploring new adventures with my friends, and maintaining my foundation. </p>
